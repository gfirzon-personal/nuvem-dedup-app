Using `pandas` to read and process CSV data can provide several advantages over the basic csv module:

1. **Ease of Use**: `pandas` provides a more convenient and powerful API for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Performance**: `pandas` is optimized for performance and can handle larger datasets more efficiently.
3. **Data Analysis**: `pandas` offers a wide range of functions for data analysis, including filtering, grouping, and statistical analysis.
4. **Data Cleaning**: `pandas` has built-in functions for handling missing data, duplicates, and other common data cleaning tasks.
5. **Integration**: `pandas` integrates well with other data science libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

Here's how you can modify your script to use `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

def count_records_in_csv_panda(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    return len(df)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = './_data/generated_batch_sample.csv'  # Replace with your CSV file path
    print(f"Number of records: {count_records_in_csv(file_path)}")
```

This script uses `pandas` to read the CSV file into a DataFrame and then returns the number of rows in the DataFrame, which corresponds to the number of records in the CSV file.
